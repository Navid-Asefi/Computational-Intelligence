# Genetic Algorithm: Selection Methods & Crossovers

## Overview
This project explores **Genetic Algorithms (GA)** and focuses on different **selection methods** and **crossover techniques** used in evolutionary computation. Genetic Algorithms are optimization heuristics inspired by the process of natural selection, commonly used for solving complex problems.

## Features
- Implementation of various **selection methods**:
  - Random Selection 
  - Roulette Wheel Selection
  - Rank-Based Selection
  - Tournament Selection
  - Truncation Selection
- Implementation of different **crossover techniques**:
  - Single-Point Crossover
  - Two-Point Crossover
  - Uniform Crossover
  - Arithmetic Crossover
- Flexible framework for experimentation and benchmarking
- Visualization of selection and crossover effects on population evolution

## Installation
Clone this repository and cd into it:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Navid-Asefi/Computational-Intelligence
cd Computational-Intelligence
```

## Usage
Run the main script to experiment with different selection and crossover methods:
```sh
python main.py
```
